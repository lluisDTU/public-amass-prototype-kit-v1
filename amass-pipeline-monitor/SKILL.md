# Pipeline Monitor CI Agent (Amass Cross-core)

Build a working weekly CI-analyst delivery (MCP slash-command + Markdown digest + 3-panel dashboard) on the Amass API. The user is a **competitive-intelligence analyst at a mid-cap immuno-oncology biotech** who just got Amass API credentials and wants a per-sponsor weekly pipeline digest — new Phase 2/3 trials, new published evidence describing those trials via the trial→paper cross-core edge, retraction-flagged citations — running locally in **under five minutes**.

The analyst pastes a YAML sponsor watchlist (canonical sponsors + indication-cluster scope) and clicks **Run digest**; the app issues a per-sponsor TrialCore search filtered to Phase 2/3 + recent `minStartDate`, walks each surfaced trial's `referencesBiomedCore` cross-core edge, resolves per-paper trust signals (`isRetracted`, `journalQualityJufo`, `citationCount`), and emits a Markdown digest grouped by sponsor — rendered inline as a 3-panel weekly dashboard. The worked example anchors on a **SCLC-DLL3-2026Q2** watchlist (Amgen + Roche + AbbVie + Boehringer Ingelheim + Harpoon Therapeutics) bound to the verified Tarlatamab identifier set: pivotal **DeLLphi-301 = NCT05060016**, confirmatory **DeLLphi-304 = NCT05740566**, primary publication **PMID 37861218** (Ahn MJ et al., NEJM 2023). `[Tarlatamab anchor set verified against PubMed + ClinicalTrials.gov + FDA approval letter at draft time]`

## Stack — pin tight

Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript. Pin with caret ranges for compatible patch updates:

```json
"@ai-sdk/react":          "^1.0.0",
"ai":                     "^4.0.0",
"next":                   "^14.2.0",
"react":                  "^18.3.1",
"react-dom":              "^18.3.1",
"react-markdown":         "^9.0.0",
"zod":                    "^3.23.8",
"lucide-react":           "^0.453.0",
"server-only":            "^0.0.1"
```

The `next` / `ai` / `@ai-sdk/react` triplet must co-pin: the dashboard's optional per-sponsor streaming progress display uses `ai` SDK primitives that change shape across minor versions. `zod` is pinned because the request-body schema is the contract; `server-only` is the build-time enforcement Hard Rule #2 depends on.

After scaffolding, run `npm install`. If any package fails to resolve, check `node_modules/<pkg>/package.json` for the latest stable version and update accordingly.

## What the app should do

The primary analyst-visible payoff is a **3-panel weekly dashboard** rendered inline as the `/api/digest-run` response: **new trials this week** (left panel — surfaced via per-sponsor TrialCore search filtered to Phase 2/3 + `minStartDate=<last_check>`); **new papers describing watched trials** (center panel — surfaced via the trial→paper cross-core walk on `include=referencesBiomedCore` per surfaced trial); **retraction-flagged citations** (right panel — populated when any walked paper carries `isRetracted = true`). The load-bearing Amass primitive the surface demonstrates is the conjunction of **canonical `AMTC_` IDs that survive NCT registry revisions** (a week-over-week diff keyed on `AMTC_` does not drift when CT.gov rewrites the NCT underneath) **plus the trial→paper cross-core edge** (`referencesBiomedCore`) — one Amass call surfaces the paper-side context that on PubMed + CT.gov + OpenAlex requires 3-4 calls across separate entity-key systems.

The input surface is a **YAML sponsor watchlist** with canonical sponsors + indication-cluster scope + cadence. The empty-state shows a **"Try sample"** button loading the SCLC-DLL3-2026Q2 worked example verbatim (`sponsors: [Amgen, Roche, AbbVie, Boehringer Ingelheim, Harpoon Therapeutics]`; `phases: [PHASE2, PHASE2_PHASE3, PHASE3]`; `last_check: 2026-05-13`). PMIDs / DOIs / NCTs / `AMBC_` / `AMTC_` IDs render in IBM Plex Mono throughout; sponsor names and paper titles render in Inter.

**Step 0 and Step 0.5 (executed once at watchlist onboarding).** Sponsor-name canonicalisation pass: issue one `query=<sponsor>` TrialCore search per raw sponsor name; cluster the returned `sponsorName` strings via case-fold + drop common suffixes (`Inc`, `Bio`, `Sciences`, `Therapeutics`, `Pharmaceuticals`, `GmbH`, `Ltd`); present ambiguous clusters with 3-5 sample trials each for analyst-confirm; persist the analyst-confirmed canonical→aliases map into the watchlist YAML. **Genentech ↔ Roche** is the canonical example — Genentech is a Roche subsidiary with its own `sponsorName` string in CT.gov; the analyst confirms during onboarding that Genentech rolls up to Roche for this watchlist. Then Step 0.5 cardinality probe: per canonical sponsor, issue one `query=<canonical>&phase=PHASE2&phase=PHASE2_PHASE3&phase=PHASE3` (no `minStartDate`) and verify the returned array has `< 300` records (the `limit=300` ceiling on the TrialCore search endpoint); sponsors exceeding 300 prompt the analyst to narrow the indication scope before onboarding completes. Both steps are PROSE-described workflow surfaces in the dashboard's onboarding flow — not separate snippet-included routes.

The cron + fan-out + cancel UX runs per-weekly digest. Per-sponsor TrialCore search (5 sponsors × 2 calls for the dual-query date-filter workaround per Hard Rule #10 = 10 calls at start) plus per-trial cross-core walk (~10 new trials per weekly run typical) plus per-paper resolution (~30 unique papers after dedup) totals roughly **50-150 calls per weekly run** with ~2-6 min wall-time on the SCLC-DLL3-2026Q2 watchlist scale. The route wraps the fan-out async generator in `withIdleTimeout(gen, 180_000)` per Hard Rule #7; the dashboard renders an analyst-visible **Cancel** button next to the **Run digest** action while the fan-out is in flight; the final state is a downloadable Markdown digest (`digest-<watchlist>-<YYYY-Wnn>.md`) with copy-citations-to-clipboard buttons on each paper card. **NO digest-history append-only persistence in v0.1** — that lives in the Hand-off "Want to extend it?" follow-on. Lovable produces the dashboard UI shape from this spec; visual variability across builders is fine — the load-bearing constraint is that the 3-panel decomposition (trials / papers / retractions) and the IBM Plex Mono rendering of identifier strings demonstrate the distinctive Amass primitives.

## Hard rules

The 8 Amass-universal rules below are inherited verbatim across all 6 prototype SKILL.mds. Per-prototype rules 9-13 follow; each is 2-4 sentences with a one-line rationale covering load-bearing surfaces, not exhaustive coverage.

1. **Credentials never enter committed code.** Generate `.env` and `.gitignore` it. Ask the user to paste credentials at hand-off:
   ```env
   AMASS_API_KEY=your_amass_api_key_here
   AMASS_API_BASE_URL=https://api.amass.tech
   ```
   Per Amass API conventions: the key reads from `AMASS_API_KEY`, the base URL from `AMASS_API_BASE_URL` (default `https://api.amass.tech`). Never hardcode, never log, never commit.

2. **Server-only `AmassClient`.** Lives in `lib/amass.ts` with `import "server-only"` at the top. Never imported from a `"use client"` component. The browser only ever speaks to `/api/<endpoint>`. The Bearer token must never reach the browser bundle; the `server-only` package enforces this at build time.

3. **Singleton/cached `AmassClient`.** Created once on server boot via `getAmassClient()` factory, cached via `clientPromise ??=` pattern. Per-request instantiation is wasted work; the Bearer header is computed once at module-import time and reused.

4. **`Authorization: Bearer ${AMASS_API_KEY}` on every Amass request.** On `401` / `403`, surface the credential error directly — retry won't fix it. On `429`, read `Retry-After` and back off exponentially (per the `lib/amass.ts` snippet below). Rate limit is **60 requests / 60 seconds, per user+org** — the per-call retry helper IS the rate-limit defence for the per-weekly fan-out.

5. **Read from the `data` key; handle errors at top-level AND per-item.** Two distinct error shapes: top-level (any non-2xx) — `{"error": {"status": ..., "code": ..., "message": ...}}` — caught by the route's outer `try/catch`. Per-item (`POST /records/lookup` returns HTTP 200 with body `{"data": [...]}` — the universal envelope applies here too) — each array element echoes the input alongside the result: `{"input": {...}, "amassIds": ["AMBC_..."]}` for success, or `{"input": {...}, "error": {"code": "NOT_FOUND", "message": "Identifier not found"}}` for failure (error is a structured object with `code` + `message` fields, NOT a bare string — empirically verified via direct curl on 2026-05-26). The `lib/amass.ts` `batchLookupBiomed` / `batchLookupTrial` methods unwrap the `data` envelope; the `mapLookupResult` helper extracts `error.message` to a string for caller-side rendering, preserving positional index alignment with the input items. **Never assume HTTP 200 means every item succeeded. Never render `error` as a React child directly — extract `.message` first or React #31 crashes the surface.**

6. **Lookup endpoints translate PMID/DOI/NCT → canonical `AMBC_`/`AMTC_` before fetching by ID.** Raw HTTP `GET /records/{id}` accepts **only** canonical Amass IDs. The workflow for v0.1's all-from-cross-core path: `searchTrialcore(<sponsor>, ...)` returns `AMTC_` IDs directly (no lookup needed); each trial's `referencesBiomedCore` array returns `AMBC_` IDs directly (no lookup needed). The `resolvePmid` / `resolveDoi` / `resolveNct` helpers are baked into `lib/amass.ts` for analyst-supplied PMID/DOI/NCT seed extensions.

7. **Idle-timeout + analyst-visible cancel button on long-running fan-outs.** Per the kit's handoff Section 6. Three requirements: (a) the route wraps any fan-out async generator in `withIdleTimeout(gen, 180_000)` — if no chunk arrives for 180s, the wrapper throws; (b) the client renders an analyst-visible **Cancel** button next to the **Run digest** action while the digest is in flight; (c) the route wraps body parse + client setup in an outer `try/catch` returning `Response.json({error}, {status: 500})`. Without all three, a single stalled Amass call locks the dashboard indefinitely on the 50-150-call-per-run fan-out.

8. **Ground-truth discipline.** Every URL, type, function name, version, and config shape in this SKILL.md must come from a source the agent can read — a fetched doc page, a `.d.ts` from the installed SDK, or the installed package's exports. If you can't point to a source, don't write it. Forbidden: fabricating endpoints; guessing field names; `as unknown as ...` or `as any` on SDK values; ignoring `tsc` errors. When the runtime contradicts what's written here, fix the cause.

### Per-prototype hard rules

9. **Sponsor-name canonicalisation at watchlist onboarding (Step 0).** Cluster `sponsorName` strings via case-fold + drop common suffixes (`Inc` / `Bio` / `Sciences` / `Therapeutics` / `Pharmaceuticals` / `GmbH` / `Ltd`); present ambiguous clusters with 3-5 sample trials each for analyst-confirm; persist the analyst-confirmed canonical→aliases map into the watchlist YAML. **Genentech ↔ Roche** is the canonical worked example — surface the disambiguation chip in the dashboard whenever Genentech appears in the raw watchlist. **Rationale:** silent N→1 collapse on sponsor name = silent over/under-count of competitor pipeline activity = load-bearing data-quality risk for the analyst; the workflow needs human-in-the-loop confirmation once, not a heuristic guess every week.

10. **`minStartDate` filter-correctness probe (dual-query workaround).** For each per-sponsor TrialCore search, issue the `minStartDate=<last_check>` query AND apply `lastUpdateDate >= <last_check>` + `startDate >= <last_check>` post-filter client-side; diff the two result sets and surface any anomaly into a digest sidecar as an audit entry. Threshold guidance: **`<5/week` is mechanical noise** (sidecar note only); **`5-20/week` triggers an analyst-review sample**; **`>20/week OR >10% per-sponsor` escalates to Amass support**. **Rationale:** phantom-empty digest from a wrong-direction date-semantic erodes the canonical-ID stability moat at runtime; the dual-query is mechanical overhead, not a blocker.

11. **Trial→paper direction only on cross-core walk (v0.1).** v0.1 uses `include=referencesBiomedCore` on the TrialCore-side GET only (Call 2). The paper→trial direction (`referencesTrialCore` on the BiomedCore record) is the regulatory-evidence-assembler's territory, not this prototype's. Honest-frame empty `referencesBiomedCore` arrays (e.g., a brand-new Phase-2 trial registered this week with no published evidence yet) as **honest emptiness** in the center panel, NOT a workflow halt. **Rationale:** foreclosing the reverse direction keeps v0.1 within published API guarantees; at-scale symmetry between trial-side and paper-side cross-core references is not yet a published guarantee and the v0.1 demo does not exercise the symmetry assumption.

12. **Per-item-error verbatim preservation.** Surface any upstream-generated error-reason strings verbatim in the digest's error column — never paraphrased, never elided. The `mapLookupResult` helper in `lib/amass.ts` enforces this. This is load-bearing for analyst-supplied PMID/DOI seed extensions (the lookup endpoint returns per-item error objects that the digest must surface verbatim); non-load-bearing for v0.1's all-`AMBC_`-from-cross-core path; baked in for kit-wide cross-prototype consistency. **Rationale:** the auditable-gap-vs-audit-failure distinction is the load-bearing Amass distinctive — PubMed E-utils silent absence; OpenAlex silent omission; Semantic Scholar null sentinels — Amass surfaces human-readable failure strings the analyst can act on.

13. **Worked-example anchoring (HIGH mixed-mode, verify-then-ship).** The dashboard displays `isRetracted` for cascade-tracked papers AND wraps "retraction-flagged citations" assertion language around them — both display=claim and pure-assertion triggers fire; the worked-example identifier set is verified against authoritative sources before publication. The "Try sample" YAML in the empty state binds:
    - `watchlist_id: SCLC-DLL3-2026Q2`
    - `sponsors: [Amgen, Roche, AbbVie, Boehringer Ingelheim, Harpoon Therapeutics]`
    - Tarlatamab anchor identifiers: **BLA 761344-dlle** / **NCT05060016** (DeLLphi-301, pivotal Phase 2) / **NCT05740566** (DeLLphi-304, confirmatory Phase 3) / **PMID 37861218** (Ahn MJ et al. NEJM 2023; verified `isRetracted=false`) / **PMID 37355629** (Rudin et al. J Hematol Oncol 2023, DLL3-targeted-therapy review; verified `isRetracted=false`) / **DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa2307980** / **FDA accelerated approval 2024-05-16**.
    - **The retraction-cascade panel renders empty (`no retractions this week`) in the SCLC-DLL3-2026Q2 worked example by design** — both walked PMIDs are verified `isRetracted=false`; the panel populates only from LIVE Amass data at digest-run time on any walked paper that is genuinely flagged retracted at that moment; never from a hardcoded fixture, never from a real-PMID-flipped-to-retracted (defamation-adjacent: an unsupported retraction display IS a retraction claim against the named work).
    - Caveat marker at all 3 anchor sites (empty-state YAML; per-paper card example; retraction-cascade panel default-state text): `[Tarlatamab anchor set verified against PubMed + ClinicalTrials.gov + FDA approval letter at draft time]`.

    **Rationale:** the workflow asserts a real paper's retraction status; this is HIGH-stakes mixed-mode and the canonical sequence is verify-then-ship — the worked-example identifier set is verified against authoritative sources before publication rather than shipping with confabulation.

The two snippets above are the **only** `lib/<file>.ts` and `app/api/<endpoint>/route.ts` mandated by the v0.1 template. **NO `app/api/digest-history/route.ts`** (week-over-week diff persistence is "Want to extend it?" territory). **NO `python_cli/digest_run.py`** (headless cron sidecar is "Want to extend it?" territory). **NO `lib/digest-store.ts`** (no persistence layer in v0.1). The dashboard renders `data.new_trials` / `data.new_papers` / `data.retraction_flagged` into the 3 panels; `data.e015_anomalies` renders into a sidecar.

## Required reading

- `https://platform.amass.tech` — Amass Platform docs + API credentials
- `https://github.com/amass-technologies/public-amass-platform-starter-ts` — official Amass Platform Starter (Apache-2.0; Bun + Ink CLI REPL with BiomedCore + TrialCore tools wired up). The engineer-facing complement to this web-app kit.

## Hand-off

Build, lint, and typecheck must pass.

**Credentials.** Get your `AMASS_API_KEY` from https://platform.amass.tech and add it to `.env`. Do NOT use `AskUserQuestion` to gate scaffolding on credentials — Lovable's (or any AI builder's) standard env-var prompt covers this at run time. Just scaffold the app with placeholder `.env`, then run `npm run dev` once the key is in place.

Then present the hand-off summary:

> **Your Pipeline Monitor CI Agent is ready.**
>
> To run it: fill in `.env` and run `npm run dev`.
>
> Verify it works:
> - Paste the SCLC-DLL3-2026Q2 watchlist YAML (or click **Try sample**); click **Run digest**; confirm all 5 sponsors expand with their Phase 2/3 trial sets and the sponsor-canonicalisation chip surfaces if Genentech appears in the raw watchlist (the dashboard rolls it up under Roche per Hard Rule #9).
> - In the **new-trials-this-week** panel (left), confirm `NCT05060016` (DeLLphi-301, Amgen, Phase 2) renders with `phase=PHASE2` and a recent `lastUpdateDate` in IBM Plex Mono; confirm `AMTC_` prefix on the trial's canonical Amass ID `[Tarlatamab anchor set verified against PubMed + ClinicalTrials.gov + FDA approval letter at draft time]`.
> - In the **new-papers-describing-watched-trials** panel (center), confirm PMID 37861218 (Ahn MJ et al. NEJM 2023) renders with a **★ credible journal** badge (live `journalQualityJufo` value from Amass — NEJM = JuFo 3) as a paper describing DeLLphi-301; confirm the paper card shows `describesTrials: [NCT05060016]` so the cross-core walk traversal is visible to the analyst.
> - In the **retraction-cascade panel** (right), confirm it renders empty (`no retractions this week`) on the SCLC-DLL3-2026Q2 worked example — both walked PMIDs (37861218, 37355629) are verified `isRetracted=false`; honest emptiness is the correct behaviour per Hard Rule #13. (Run against your own watchlist on a different week to see the panel populate from live Amass `isRetracted=true` records.)
>
> Want to extend it?
> - Add a Python CLI sidecar (`python_cli/digest_run.py`) for headless weekly cron invocation. The CLI takes the watchlist YAML path as an argument, posts to `/api/digest-run`, and writes the returned digest to `~/pipeline-monitor/<watchlist_id>/<YYYY-Wnn>.md` for Slack-paste / Confluence-paste / email-paste by the analyst.
> - Add week-over-week digest-history persistence with append-only ISO-week indexing for diff visualisation. A trial that surfaces in week N+1 but not week N gets a `new-this-week` badge; a trial whose `lastUpdateDate` advanced gets a `changed-this-week` badge.
> - Add cursor pagination for sponsors with >300 active trials per scope. The v0.1 numerical bounding caps each canonical sponsor at <300 trials at Step 0.5 cardinality probe; lifting that cap requires a cursor-pagination surface (pending an upstream Amass API extension).
> - I'm done — just show me the summary.
