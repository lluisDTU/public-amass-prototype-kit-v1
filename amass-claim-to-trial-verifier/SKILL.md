# Claim-to-Trial Verifier (Amass Cross-core)

Build a working marketing-claim-to-trial verifier on the Amass API. The user is a regulatory consultant reviewing promotional material (FDA OPDP-adjacent per brief 09:30) or an investigative journalist auditing pharma marketing claims, who just got Amass API credentials and wants a TypeScript claim-verification tool running locally in under five minutes. Lovable typically scaffolds TanStack Start (TanStack Router + `createServerFn` server-functions); Next.js (App Router with `app/api/<endpoint>/route.ts`) is the alternative path. Both work end-to-end against the same `lib/amass.ts` client pattern — the Amass primitives are stack-agnostic.

The consultant pastes a marketing claim about a drug plus the 1-5 DOIs the promotional copy cites; the tool resolves each cited DOI to a canonical `AMBC_` Amass ID, walks the paper→trial cross-core edge per cited paper (`include=referencesTrialCore`), retrieves the cited trial's registered primary outcome measures (`include=outcomes`), and surfaces a verdict card per claim — the **trial's actual primary endpoint rendered verbatim from the registered protocol** next to the claim text, with a flagged verdict (`supported` / `not_supported` / `contradicts` / `needs_review`). The verifier never paraphrases trial outcomes; it surfaces them verbatim so the analyst makes the final call. The worked example binds the verified Tarlatamab (Imdelltra) / Amgen identifier set: claim "Tarlatamab improves overall survival in previously-treated ES-SCLC" + DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa2307980 (Ahn MJ et al. NEJM 2023, DeLLphi-301 primary publication) → resolves to NCT05060016 → trial primary endpoint surfaces as Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1, NOT Overall Survival → expected verdict `needs_review`. `[identifier-verified per WebFetch against ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05060016 + Amass MCP get-by-NCT on 2026-05-21; DeLLphi-301 primary endpoint = Objective Response per RECIST 1.1 (Investigator + BICR); cross-prototype-consistency Probe-1-lockstep with Prototype 1's W2-verified Tarlatamab set at notes/worked-example-verification-brief-05-tarlatamab.md commit 0a29140]`

## Stack — flexible at the framework layer, principle-pinned at the API layer

**TypeScript + React + a server-function-capable framework.** Lovable defaults to **TanStack Start** (`@tanstack/react-router` + `@tanstack/react-start`'s `createServerFn` for server-side handlers). **Next.js (App Router)** with `app/api/<endpoint>/route.ts` POST handlers is the equivalent alternative path. Both work end-to-end against the same `lib/amass.ts` client; pick whichever your AI builder produces by default. The Amass primitives (canonical-ID resolution + per-item-error semantics + the paper→trial cross-core walk + verbatim-outcome render) are stack-agnostic — the framework only wraps them. The reference snippets below happen to use the Next.js shape (`route.ts` + `POST(req)`); the load-bearing constraints (server-only client, per-item-error handling, verbatim-outcome discipline) transfer cleanly to TanStack Start.

These package versions are load-bearing — do not upgrade without testing:

```json
"@amass/sdk":             "{{amass-sdk-version}}",
"@ai-sdk/react":          "{{ai-sdk-react-version}}",
"ai":                     "{{ai-version}}",
"react":                  "{{react-version}}",
"react-dom":              "{{react-dom-version}}",
"react-markdown":         "{{react-markdown-version}}",
"zod":                    "{{zod-version}}",
"lucide-react":           "{{lucide-react-version}}",
"server-only":            "{{server-only-version}}"
```

Add the framework packages on top of the above — one set OR the other, not both: **Next.js path** adds `next`; **TanStack Start path** adds `@tanstack/react-router`, `@tanstack/react-start`, `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`.

Pin as **exact versions** (no `^`). `@amass/sdk` is pinned exactly because the cross-core walk semantics (`referencesTrialCore` paper-side array shape per `01-capabilities/capability-map.md:183`) and the TrialCore `include=outcomes` structured response shape per `capability-map.md:311` are load-bearing for the verifier's verbatim-outcome rendering — any SDK version that paraphrases, normalises, or restructures the per-trial primary outcome text breaks Hard Rule #12 (verbatim outcome discipline). `ai` / `@ai-sdk/react` are co-pinned for kit-wide consistency with the other 5 prototypes in `06-prototype-kit/`; v0.1 returns a consolidated JSON payload (non-streaming) so that pinning is not load-bearing for this prototype, but kept aligned so future streaming-progress work re-uses the kit-wide stack.

**Resolve `{{version}}` placeholders before `npm install`** — per Hard Rule #8 (ground-truth discipline), per-prototype dispatch reads installed `node_modules/<pkg>/package.json` for actual versions. A literal `{{amass-sdk-version}}` in `package.json` triggers `npm ERR! EINVALIDTAGNAME` and aborts the install.

## What the app should do

The primary analyst-visible payoff is the **per-claim verdict card** — one card per submitted claim, surfacing four things together: the claim text verbatim, the cited DOIs verbatim, the walked trial(s) with their **registered primary outcome text rendered verbatim from the trial protocol**, and the verdict (`supported` / `not_supported` / `contradicts` / `needs_review`) with a 1-2 sentence reasoning. The load-bearing Amass primitive is the paper→trial cross-core walk via `referencesTrialCore` per `capability-map.md:183` chained into TrialCore `include=outcomes` per `capability-map.md:311` — a 3-call chain (DOI→`AMBC_` lookup, BiomedCore GET with `referencesTrialCore`, TrialCore GET with `outcomes`) that no free-tier API exposes as a structured walk. Text-mining the paper for NCT identifiers is the workaround the verifier's moat foreclosese per brief 09:47 (recall-gap risk + citation-chain drift across NCT registry revisions).

The input surface is a **claim textarea + cited-DOI list** — a textarea accepting a free-text claim ("Tarlatamab improves overall survival in previously-treated ES-SCLC") plus a comma-or-newline-separated list of 1-5 cited DOIs. The empty-state "Try sample" loads the verified Tarlatamab worked example verbatim — claim `"Tarlatamab improves overall survival in previously-treated ES-SCLC"` + cited DOI `10.1056/NEJMoa2307980`. The tooltip on the Try-sample button reads "Tarlatamab (Imdelltra) / Amgen — Ahn MJ et al. NEJM 2023, DeLLphi-301 primary publication. Expected verdict: needs_review (DeLLphi-301's primary endpoint is ORR per RECIST 1.1, not OS). `[identifier-verified per WebFetch against ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05060016 + Amass MCP get-by-NCT on 2026-05-21; Probe-1-lockstep with Prototype 1's W2-verified Tarlatamab set]`".

The verification run is a 3-call fan-out — Call 1 (`batchLookupBiomed` on the cited DOIs) + Call 2 per resolved `AMBC_` (`getBiomedRecord` with `include=referencesTrialCore`) + Call 3 per unique walked `AMTC_` (`getTrialRecord` with `include=outcomes`). Typical per-claim wall-time is 5-15 seconds for 1-5 DOIs (well below the rate-limit ceiling per brief 09:58); the route wraps the per-paper + per-trial fan-out generator in `withIdleTimeout(gen, 180_000)` per Hard Rule #7 and the client renders an analyst-visible **Cancel** button next to the primary "Verify claim" action while the fan-out is in flight. A progress indicator increments per resolved DOI then per walked trial ("resolving DOI 2 of 3", then "walking trial 1 of 2"); a stalled Amass call past the 180s idle threshold surfaces a "stream stalled — an Amass call likely hung" error without locking the UI indefinitely.

The final state is a **per-claim verdict card** rendered in-page with five fields visible: (a) the claim text verbatim in Inter; (b) the cited DOIs in IBM Plex Mono; (c) the walked trial cards — `AMTC_` ID + `NCT` ID + brief title + **primary outcome text VERBATIM from `outcomeMeasures` / structured `outcomes` response**, never paraphrased; (d) the verdict badge (color-coded — green for supported, amber for needs_review, red for contradicts, grey for not_supported); (e) the 1-2 sentence reasoning naming the specific outcome-category match-or-mismatch. Each walked trial card's `AMTC_` ID and `NCT` ID render as **clickable links to the Amass platform's trial-detail surface** (link shape `https://platform.amass.tech/records/trialcore/{amassId}` `[design-claim — confirm link shape with Amass platform team; not empirically verifiable against the capability-map, which documents only the api.amass.tech API surface]`) so the analyst can open and inspect the registered trial record directly behind the verbatim outcome text — non-clickable `AMTC_` chips were a documented V2 finding on Prototype 1's first Lovable scaffold (B6.11), and the verdict card's value depends on the analyst being able to reach the trial record the verdict rests on. The v0.1 returns the assembled verdict in a single consolidated JSON response — there is no multi-claim batching, no persistence layer, and no v1.0 trial-results-magnitude comparison (those land under "Want to extend it?" in Hand-off). Render PMIDs / DOIs / NCTs / `AMBC_` / `AMTC_` IDs in IBM Plex Mono; prose in Inter (Brand reference). Use Lucide React for icons. Lovable produces the UI shape from this spec — variability across builders is fine; the load-bearing constraint is that the four paragraphs above demonstrate the paper→trial cross-core walk, the verbatim-outcome rendering, the verdict-with-reasoning shape, and the worked-example anchor.

## Hard rules

The 8 Amass-universal rules below are inherited verbatim across all 6 prototype SKILL.mds. Per-prototype rules 9-13 cover the load-bearing UX / error / discipline surfaces specific to brief 09.

1. **Credentials never enter committed code.** Generate `.env` and `.gitignore` it. Only ONE secret is asked of the user at hand-off:
   ```env
   AMASS_API_KEY=your_amass_api_key_here
   ```
   Per `CLAUDE.md` API conventions: the key reads from `AMASS_API_KEY`. The base URL is **hardcoded** to `https://api.amass.tech` in `lib/amass.ts` (single production base; no per-user variance). To point at staging or a local proxy for development, edit the `AMASS_API_BASE_URL` constant in `lib/amass.ts` directly — do NOT re-introduce an env var for this (adding `process.env.AMASS_API_BASE_URL` to `lib/amass.ts` causes Lovable's secrets-UX to prompt the user for a value they don't have, which is unnecessary friction). Never hardcode the API key, never log it, never commit it.

2. **Server-only `AmassClient`.** Lives in `lib/amass.ts` with `import "server-only"` at the top. Never imported from a `"use client"` component. The browser only ever speaks to `/api/<endpoint>`. The Bearer token must never reach the browser bundle; the `server-only` package enforces this at build time.

3. **Singleton/cached `AmassClient`.** Created once on server boot via `getAmassClient()` factory, cached via `clientPromise ??=` pattern. Per-request instantiation is wasted work; the Bearer header is computed once at module-import time and reused.

4. **`Authorization: Bearer ${AMASS_API_KEY}` on every Amass request.** Per `01-capabilities/capability-map.md` shared-auth section. On `401` / `403`, surface the credential error directly — retry won't fix it. On `429`, read `Retry-After` and back off exponentially (per the `lib/amass.ts` snippet below). Rate limit is **60 requests / 60 seconds, per user+org** — the per-call retry helper IS the rate-limit defence for fan-out workflows.

5. **Read from the `data` key; handle errors at top-level AND per-item.** Per `capability-map.md:121`. Two distinct error shapes: top-level (any non-2xx) — `{"error": {"status": ..., "code": ..., "message": ...}}` — caught by the route's outer `try/catch`. Per-item (`POST /records/lookup` returns HTTP 200 with body `{"data": [...]}` — the universal envelope applies here too) — each array element echoes the input alongside the result: `{"input": {...}, "amassIds": ["AMBC_..."]}` for success, or `{"input": {...}, "error": {"code": "NOT_FOUND", "message": "Identifier not found"}}` for failure (error is a structured object with `code` + `message` fields, NOT a bare string — empirically verified via direct curl on 2026-05-26). The `lib/amass.ts` `batchLookupBiomed` / `batchLookupTrial` methods unwrap the `data` envelope; the `mapLookupResult` helper extracts `error.message` to a string for caller-side rendering, preserving positional index alignment with the input items. **Never assume HTTP 200 means every item succeeded. Never render `error` as a React child directly — extract `.message` first or React #31 crashes the surface.**

6. **Lookup endpoints translate PMID/DOI/NCT → canonical `AMBC_`/`AMTC_` before fetching by ID.** Per `capability-map.md` §biomedcore-batch-lookup / §trialcore-batch-lookup. Raw HTTP `GET /records/{id}` accepts **only** canonical Amass IDs — passing a DOI directly returns 404. The workflow is always: `POST /records/lookup` with `[{doi: "..."}]` → read `amassIds[0]` (handling per-item-error per Rule #5) → `GET /records/{amassId}`. The `lib/amass.ts` `resolvePmid` / `resolveDoi` / `resolveNct` helpers encode this discipline.

7. **Idle-timeout + analyst-visible cancel button on long-running fan-outs.** Per `handoff-2026-05-21-workstream-C-prototype-kit.md` Section 6. Three requirements: (a) the route wraps any fan-out async generator in `withIdleTimeout(gen, 180_000)` — if no chunk arrives for 180s, the wrapper throws; (b) the client renders an analyst-visible **Cancel** button next to the primary action while a fan-out is in flight; (c) the route wraps body parse + client setup in an outer `try/catch` returning `Response.json({error}, {status: 500})`. Without all three, a single stalled Amass call locks the UI indefinitely.

8. **Ground-truth discipline.** Every URL, type, function name, version, and config shape in this SKILL.md must come from a source the agent can read — a fetched doc page, a `.d.ts` in `node_modules/@amass/sdk/`, the installed package's exports, or a verbatim quote from `01-capabilities/capability-map.md`. If you can't point to a source, don't write it. Forbidden: fabricating endpoints; guessing field names; `as unknown as ...` or `as any` on `@amass/sdk` values; ignoring `tsc` errors. When the runtime contradicts what's written here, fix the cause.

### Per-prototype hard rules

9. **Single-claim-with-cited-DOIs input discipline (v0.1).** Brief 09's v0.1 path is exactly 1 claim + 1-5 cited DOIs per verification run — the typical FDA OPDP / journalistic single-promotional-piece review unit. Multi-claim batching across multiple promotional pieces is a v1.0 extension surfaced in Hand-off's "Want to extend it?" follow-on. Rationale: bounded fan-out (~5-15 API calls per claim per brief 09:51 + :58) sits well below the 60 req / 60 s rate-limit ceiling, and per-claim manual review is the regulatory-consultant workflow shape — batching across claims dilutes the verdict-card-as-single-decision-unit pattern that the analyst's review process needs.

10. **Paper→trial cross-core walk via `referencesTrialCore` (load-bearing edge).** Per brief 09:38 + :40 and `capability-map.md:183`: the load-bearing edge is `referencesTrialCore` on the paper-side BiomedCore GET — `AMBC_` (resolved from cited DOI) → `referencesTrialCore` array of `AMTC_` IDs. The v0.1 walks in the paper→trial direction only; the reverse direction (`NCT` → all supporting publications via TrialCore `referencesBiomedCore`) is explicitly foreclosed because the at-scale symmetry of the cross-core spine is `[doc-silent / not yet a published guarantee]` per E-007 at `03-positioning/narrative.md:21` and per brief 05's Hard Rule #12 inheritance. Empty `referencesTrialCore` arrays (paper has no cited trials — review article shape) render as **honest emptiness** — verdict surfaces as `not_supported` with reasoning "no trial reference in cross-core spine on cited paper" — not as a workflow halt. Rationale: no free-tier API exposes paper→trial as a structured field with canonical-ID delivery per brief 09:45-47; text-mining for NCT identifiers in paper text is the workaround that misses NCTs appearing only in methods or supplements (recall gap) AND drifts across NCT registry revisions (citation-chain drift).

11. **TrialCore primary outcome retrieval via `include=outcomes`.** Per `capability-map.md:311` and brief 09:38 + :40: the trial-side `GET /api/v1/cores/trialcore/records/{amassId}?include=outcomes` returns the structured `outcomes` object array with the registered primary outcome measures rendered verbatim from the trial protocol. The default field `primaryOutcomeMeasures` per `capability-map.md:291` (TrialCore default-fields table) is a string[] of outcome-measure titles — sufficient for the verdict-card render. The verifier surfaces the trial's REGISTERED primary endpoint, not the publication's reported outcome metric — the trial registration is the load-bearing ground truth for an OPDP-style claim audit per brief 09's regulatory-consultant ICP framing. Rationale: the verifier's value depends on showing the analyst the TRIAL'S ACTUAL registered outcome (not a publication summary or a marketing paraphrase); the LLM-compare step is bespoke claim-vs-registered-outcome verification, NOT Scite-style citation-context classification on the paper-citation graph (AP-6 non-trespass per brief 09:63).

12. **Verdict discipline — verbatim outcome text + flagged verdict + analyst-as-final-arbiter framing.** The verdict card surfaces FIVE fields together, each with non-negotiable discipline: (a) the **claim text verbatim** as submitted by the user — never paraphrased, never normalised; (b) the **cited DOIs verbatim** as submitted by the user; (c) the **walked `AMTC_`(s) with `nctId` + `briefTitle`** rendered from the live TrialCore record; (d) the **trial primary outcome text VERBATIM from `outcomeMeasures` / structured `outcomes` response** — surfaced as-rendered from the Amass record, with no LLM rewrite, paraphrase, or summarisation between Amass's response and the analyst's screen; (e) the **verdict badge with 1-2 sentence reasoning** naming the specific outcome-category match-or-mismatch. The reasoning text is LLM-authored but constrained — it cites the verbatim claim phrasing AND the verbatim trial outcome phrasing AND names the specific direction-or-category alignment that drove the verdict; it does NOT assert truth or falsity of the claim beyond what the trial's REGISTERED primary endpoint supports. Rationale: the regulatory consultant or journalist needs the TRIAL DATA as the authoritative anchor to make the final call (a `contradicts` verdict on a real promotional piece against a real pharma sponsor is defamation-adjacent — see Hard Rule #13); the LLM-compare provides initial framing and a 1-2 sentence reasoning prompt, NOT the final published verdict.

13. **Worked-example anchoring (HIGH pure-assertion, VERIFIED-then-shipped).** Per `.claude/skills/worked-example-anchoring/SKILL.md` section (d) line 87 — Prototype 6 is **HIGH, pure-assertion** (workflow asserts a real marketing claim is unsupported by a real trial registration; no display of underlying status fields softens the assertion the way Prototype 1's mixed-mode `isRetracted` column does). The "Try sample" claim+DOI in the empty state binds the within-dispatch-verified Tarlatamab identifiers **verbatim** — claim "Tarlatamab improves overall survival in previously-treated ES-SCLC" + DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa2307980 (Ahn MJ et al. NEJM 2023, DeLLphi-301 primary publication) → walks to NCT05060016 (DeLLphi-301) → primary outcome surfaces verbatim as "Part 1 Only: Objective Response (OR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by Investigator" (verified via WebFetch against ClinicalTrials.gov API v2 on 2026-05-21 + Amass MCP get-by-NCT on 2026-05-21; trial's other primary outcomes are TEAEs, serum concentrations, and ORR by BICR — none is Overall Survival). Expected verdict on the worked example: `needs_review` (claim's stated outcome category = Overall Survival does not match trial's registered primary endpoint category = Objective Response Rate per RECIST 1.1). The trial primary outcome text in the verdict card populates from the **live Amass record at run time**, never from a hardcoded fixture, never from a paraphrased summary, never from a real-trial-flipped-to-different-outcome-for-illustration — defamation-adjacent under the display=claim rule per the skill #8 4-mode sub-table Pure-assertion row. Carry the caveat marker `[identifier-verified per WebFetch against ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05060016 + Amass MCP get-by-NCT on 2026-05-21; DeLLphi-301 primary endpoint = ORR per RECIST 1.1 (Investigator + BICR); Probe-1-lockstep with Prototype 1's W2-verified Tarlatamab set at notes/worked-example-verification-brief-05-tarlatamab.md commit 0a29140]` at three anchor sites: the title intro paragraph, the Try-sample tooltip, and the Hand-off verification preamble. Rationale: brief 09 ships a pure-assertion workflow against named pharma sponsors + named promotional claims; shipping it without within-dispatch verification of the worked example's claim-vs-actual-trial-outcome chain would be the worst case of the failure mode skill #8 exists to prevent — the prototype's value-moment is correctly flagging a real claim/outcome mismatch against a registered trial, which requires the registered-trial side to be empirically verified before binding.

Takes a JSON body `{claim: string, cited_dois: string[]}`, runs Call 1 (`batchLookupBiomed` on cited DOIs) → fans out Call 2 (`getBiomedRecord` per resolved `AMBC_`) → de-duplicates the union of walked `AMTC_` IDs → fans out Call 3 (`getTrialRecord` per unique `AMTC_`) wrapped in `withIdleTimeout(gen, 180_000)` per Hard Rule #7 → runs the LLM-compare step to author the verdict + reasoning → returns the assembled verdict card in one consolidated JSON response.

The two snippets above are the only `lib/<file>.ts` + `app/api/<route>/route.ts` mandated by this prototype. v0.1 returns the assembled verdict card in-memory in a single consolidated response — there is no persistence module, no multi-claim batching store, no `app/api/batch-verify/route.ts`, no Python CLI sidecar. Render happens client-side from the response payload. If a downstream extension needs persistence (audit history of past verifications, multi-claim batch sessions), the extension SKILL.md includes its own minimal stub per the template's policy — never an `import` from `@/lib/<x>` without a matching snippet.

## Hand-off

Build, lint, and typecheck must pass.

**Credentials.** Get your `AMASS_API_KEY` from https://platform.amass.tech and add it to `.env`. Do NOT use `AskUserQuestion` to gate scaffolding on credentials — Lovable's (or any AI builder's) standard env-var prompt covers this at run time. Just scaffold the app with placeholder `.env`, then run `npm run dev` once the key is in place.

Then present the hand-off summary. The four verification steps bind to the within-dispatch-verified Tarlatamab identifier set `[identifier-verified per WebFetch against ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05060016 + Amass MCP get-by-NCT on 2026-05-21; DeLLphi-301 primary endpoint = ORR per RECIST 1.1 (Investigator + BICR); Probe-1-lockstep with Prototype 1's W2-verified Tarlatamab set at notes/worked-example-verification-brief-05-tarlatamab.md commit 0a29140]`:

> **Your Claim-to-Trial Verifier is ready.**
>
> To run it: fill in `.env` and run `npm run dev`.
>
> Verify it works:
> - Click **Try sample** to load the Tarlatamab claim ("Tarlatamab improves overall survival in previously-treated ES-SCLC") plus DOI `10.1056/NEJMoa2307980`; click **Verify claim**. Confirm the 3-call chain resolves: DOI → `AMBC_` (Ahn MJ et al. NEJM 2023) → `referencesTrialCore` → `AMTC_DJIWhoYfJnhExqO0I7e7y17JTSJ` (DeLLphi-301, NCT05060016) → primary outcome surfaces verbatim from Amass as "Part 1 Only: Objective Response (OR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by Investigator" (or the BICR-assessed companion outcome — both are registered primary endpoints).
> - Confirm the verdict surfaces as **`needs_review`** with the reasoning naming the claim/outcome category mismatch — claim says Overall Survival; trial's registered primary endpoint is Objective Response Rate per RECIST 1.1. The verdict card renders the claim text in Inter, the DOI in IBM Plex Mono, the walked `NCT05060016` in IBM Plex Mono, and the primary-outcome text verbatim in Inter — no LLM paraphrase between Amass's response and the screen.
> - Run a different claim against the same DOI — paste "Tarlatamab achieves an objective response in previously-treated DLL3-positive ES-SCLC" and click **Verify claim**. Confirm the verdict shifts to **`supported`** (or close approximation) with reasoning naming the outcome-category match (claim says ORR; trial primary is ORR per RECIST 1.1).
> - Paste an intentionally-invalid DOI `10.9999/this-doi-does-not-exist` into the cited-DOIs field; click **Verify claim**; confirm the row renders inline with `lookup_error` populated by the verbatim upstream string per Hard Rule #5 — without crashing the surface, and with the verdict surfacing as `not_supported` because no trial walked from the unresolved paper.
>
> Want to extend it?
> - Add multi-claim batching for OPDP enforcement-letter audits — surface a saved-session UI that runs a list of claim-DOI pairs against a single regulatory-consultant engagement, persisting verdicts to an append-only audit log keyed by `claim_id + session_id` for the engagement's submission file.
> - Add v1.0 free-text claim extraction — accept a full promotional-piece PDF or text block, run an LLM extraction step to surface the list of distinct assertions, then verify each assertion against the cited DOI set as a batched run.
> - Add trial-results-magnitude integration — for trials where CT.gov reports posted results (`hasResults=true`), retrieve the results via TrialCore `include=outcomes` (structured `outcomes` object array) and compare the claim's STATED magnitude (e.g. "30% objective response") against the trial's REPORTED magnitude, surfacing `partially_supported` for direction-correct-but-magnitude-overstated cases.

The verified primary endpoint = ORR per RECIST 1.1 binds the worked example's expected verdict of `needs_review` against the claim "improves overall survival" — the canonical pure-assertion HIGH-tier demonstration that motivated skill #8's verify-then-ship-strictly discipline for Prototype 6.
