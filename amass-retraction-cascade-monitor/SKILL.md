# Retraction Cascade Monitor (Amass BiomedCore + TrialCore)

Build a working retraction-cascade tracker on the Amass API. The user is a systematic-review researcher (Cochrane-style) re-auditing a published review's bibliography for newly-retracted citations, OR a regulatory-affairs analyst monitoring a submission's citation chain, OR a medical-affairs analyst monitoring a published medical-info answer for citation contamination (the three ICPs share the same audit-trail workflow shape — same lookup, same record-fetch, same cascade panels — and a single deployment serves all three). They just got Amass API credentials and want a Next.js + TypeScript cascade dashboard running locally in under five minutes.

The user pastes a curated bibliography PMID list (caller's stored snapshot at time t0); the tool resolves each PMID to a canonical `AMBC_` Amass ID, fetches the per-paper record with `include=references,citedBy,referencesTrialCore` (the retraction-flag default field + both-direction citation graph + cross-core trial spine — all in one record fetch per Hard Rule #10), filters to `isRetracted === true`, and surfaces the three-direction cascade: inbound (`citedBy` — what downstream papers cite the retracted work and now carry contamination), outbound (`references` — what the retracted work itself cited, often revealing the shaky evidence chain), and cross-core (`referencesTrialCore` — what trials the retracted paper describes). The worked example binds to Wakefield et al. Lancet 1998 (PMID 9500320) — the canonical retracted paper for demonstration purposes, ~3,000+ citing papers in the inbound cascade per published bibliometrics. `[identifier-verified per WebFetch against PubMed + Retraction Watch on 2026-05-21; PMID 9500320 = Wakefield et al. Lancet 1998 351(9103):637-41, fully retracted 2010-02-06 (PMID 20137807); partial retraction of interpretation 2004-03-06 (PMID 15016483)]`

## Stack — flexible at the framework layer, principle-pinned at the API layer

**TypeScript + React + a server-function-capable framework.** Lovable defaults to **TanStack Start** (`@tanstack/react-router` + `@tanstack/react-start`'s `createServerFn` for server-side handlers). **Next.js (App Router)** with `app/api/<endpoint>/route.ts` POST handlers is the equivalent alternative path. Both work end-to-end against the same `lib/amass.ts` client; pick whichever your AI builder produces by default. The Amass primitives (canonical-ID resolution + per-item-error semantics + cross-core walks + retraction-flag default field) are stack-agnostic — the framework only wraps them.

What IS pinned (load-bearing):

```json
"react":                  "^18.3.1",
"react-dom":              "^18.3.1",
"typescript":             "^5.4.5",
"zod":                    "^3.23.8",
"lucide-react":           "^0.453.0",
"server-only":            "^0.0.1"
```

What's framework-specific (one set OR the other, not both):

- **TanStack Start path**: `@tanstack/react-router`, `@tanstack/react-start`, `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`.
- **Next.js (App Router) path**: `next` (latest stable), `@types/node`.

Pin with caret ranges (`^x.y.z`) for compatible patch updates. `zod` is pinned because the input-validator schema (`CascadeRequestSchema`) is the request contract — silent zod-version drift in default-value or refine semantics shifts what the route accepts. `server-only` is pinned because it is the build-time enforcement Hard Rule #2 depends on (works identically in Next.js and TanStack Start). The per-item-error verbatim preservation (Hard Rule #11) and the three-direction-in-one-call discipline (Hard Rule #10) are load-bearing; do not paraphrase upstream error strings, do not collapse the include set across two HTTP calls.

After scaffolding, run `npm install`. If any package fails to resolve, check `node_modules/<pkg>/package.json` for the latest stable version and update accordingly.

**Three notes for AI builders that may produce either path.** (1) The route file location differs: TanStack Start uses `src/lib/<name>.functions.ts` with `createServerFn({ method: "POST" }).inputValidator(...).handler(...)`; Next.js App Router uses `app/api/<endpoint>/route.ts` with `export async function POST(req: Request)`. The reference snippet below is shown in Next.js shape — if your builder produces TanStack Start, translate the `POST(req)` handler to `createServerFn(...).handler(async ({ data }) => ...)` and the `req.json()` body parse to `.inputValidator((input) => CascadeRequestSchema.parse(input))`. (2) The page file location differs: TanStack Router uses `src/routes/index.tsx` with `createFileRoute("/")`; Next.js App Router uses `app/page.tsx`. Either way, the page calls into the server function / route handler the same way at the network level. (3) **The outer `try/catch` wrapping the handler body MUST be preserved when translating to TanStack Start.** The Next.js reference snippet wraps the cascade logic in `try { ... } catch (err) { return Response.json({error: ...}, {status: 500}) }`. For TanStack Start, wrap the `.handler()` body in `try { ... } catch (err) { throw new Error(err instanceof Error ? err.message : "Cascade audit failed"); }` — the throw surfaces as `mutation.error.message` on the client (TanStack Query's `useMutation` `isError` path) and renders in the UI's inline error region. Without this wrap, an uncaught throw from any API call propagates to TanStack Router's route-level error boundary and crashes the whole page instead of surfacing as a mutation error. Load-bearing for the kit's "per-item error renders inline without crashing the surface" claim.

## What the app should do

The primary analyst-visible payoff is a **3-panel cascade dashboard** — retracted-papers-in-bibliography (left), inbound `citedBy` cascade (center), outbound `references` + cross-core `referencesTrialCore` cascade (right). The load-bearing Amass primitive is the **three-direction-in-one-record-fetch conjunction** per Hard Rule #10: a single `GET /api/v1/cores/biomedcore/records/{amassId}?include=references,citedBy,referencesTrialCore` delivers the retraction flag (`isRetracted` is a default field — no include flag needed), the both-direction citation graph (`references` outbound + `citedBy` inbound), and the cross-core trial spine (`referencesTrialCore`) — competitors do not expose this conjunction in a single call (OpenAlex requires a second HTTP call for the cited-by direction; OpenAlex has no clinical-trial entity; Scite has no trial linkage and single-direction retraction). The retracted-papers panel renders the `isRetracted` flag, journal, and the count of downstream-contaminated papers (inbound cascade cardinality) per retracted paper.

The input surface is a **stored-bibliography PMID list textarea** — a multi-line text input accepting one PMID per line (typical SR cohort size: 100–500 PMIDs; v0.1 ceiling per Hard Rule #9 below). The empty-state "Try sample" loads the W2-verified Wakefield example verbatim — `9500320` (Wakefield Lancet 1998, full retraction 2010-02-06) plus ~10 context PMIDs from the autism-vaccination methodology literature so the cascade panels demonstrate honest cardinality (the inbound `citedBy` panel populates with the live-from-Amass list of papers that cite Wakefield; the outbound `references` panel populates with what Wakefield itself cited). The tooltip on the Try-sample button reads "Wakefield et al. Lancet 1998 (PMID 9500320), the canonical retracted paper. `[identifier-verified per WebFetch against PubMed + Retraction Watch on 2026-05-21; PMID 9500320 = Wakefield et al. Lancet 1998 351(9103):637-41, fully retracted 2010-02-06 (PMID 20137807)]`".

The audit run fans out per-paper GETs after batch lookup. On a 500-PMID bibliography the first stage is ~5 batch-lookup calls (`POST /records/lookup` with `items[].pmid`, batched to stay under any prudent per-call payload size). The second stage is the per-retracted-paper GET — typically <20 retracted papers in a 500-PMID SR cohort (real-world retraction rate ~0.04–4% depending on field, per published retraction-residue bibliometrics), so the second-stage fan-out is at most a few dozen GETs. The route wraps the per-paper fan-out generator in `withIdleTimeout(gen, 180_000)` per Hard Rule #7 and the client renders an analyst-visible **Cancel** button next to the primary "Run cascade audit" action while the fan-out is in flight. A progress indicator increments per resolved paper ("cascade audit in progress — N of M papers walked"); a stalled Amass call past the 180s idle threshold surfaces a "stream stalled — an Amass call likely hung" error without locking the UI indefinitely.

The final state is a **downloadable cascade report** (Markdown or JSON) plus a "copy citations to clipboard" affordance for the cascade-tracked papers. The cascade panels surface real retraction data from **live Amass `isRetracted` values and live `references` / `citedBy` / `referencesTrialCore` arrays** — never from hardcoded fixtures, never from a real-PMID-flipped-to-retracted-for-illustration (the display=claim rule for retraction rendering makes hardcoded retraction values defamation-adjacent per Hard Rule #13). Render PMIDs / DOIs / NCTs / `AMBC_` / `AMTC_` IDs in IBM Plex Mono; prose in Inter (Brand reference). Use Lucide React for icons. Lovable produces the UI shape from this spec — variability across builders is fine; the load-bearing constraint is that the four paragraphs above demonstrate the single-record-fetch three-direction conjunction (`isRetracted` default field + `references` + `citedBy` + `referencesTrialCore` in one call), the live-Amass retraction display, and the worked-example anchor.

## Hard rules

Per-prototype rules 9-13 cover the load-bearing UX, error, and discipline surfaces specific to the retraction-cascade workflow.

1. **Credentials never enter committed code.** Generate `.env` and `.gitignore` it. Ask the user to paste credentials at hand-off:
   ```env
   AMASS_API_KEY=your_amass_api_key_here
   ```
   Per API conventions: the key reads from `AMASS_API_KEY`. The base URL is **hardcoded** to `https://api.amass.tech` in `lib/amass.ts` (single production base; no per-user variance). To point at staging or a local proxy for development, edit the `AMASS_API_BASE_URL` constant in `lib/amass.ts` directly — do NOT re-introduce an env var for this (adding `process.env.AMASS_API_BASE_URL` to `lib/amass.ts` causes Lovable's secrets-UX to prompt the user for a value they don't have, which is unnecessary friction). Never hardcode the API key, never log it, never commit it.

2. **Server-only `AmassClient`.** Lives in `lib/amass.ts` with `import "server-only"` at the top. Never imported from a `"use client"` component. The browser only ever speaks to `/api/<endpoint>`. The Bearer token must never reach the browser bundle; the `server-only` package enforces this at build time.

3. **Singleton/cached `AmassClient`.** Created once on server boot via `getAmassClient()` factory, cached via `clientPromise ??=` pattern. Per-request instantiation is wasted work; the Bearer header is computed once at module-import time and reused.

4. **`Authorization: Bearer ${AMASS_API_KEY}` on every Amass request.** On `401` / `403`, surface the credential error directly — retry won't fix it. On `429`, read `Retry-After` and back off exponentially (per the `lib/amass.ts` snippet below). Rate limit is **60 requests / 60 seconds, per user+org** — the per-call retry helper IS the rate-limit defence for fan-out workflows.

5. **Read from the `data` key; handle errors at top-level AND per-item.** Two distinct error shapes: top-level (any non-2xx) — `{"error": {"status": ..., "code": ..., "message": ...}}` — caught by the route's outer `try/catch`. Per-item (`POST /records/lookup` returns HTTP 200 with body `{"data": [...]}` — the universal envelope applies here too) — each array element echoes the input alongside the result: `{"input": {...}, "amassIds": ["AMBC_..."]}` for success, or `{"input": {...}, "error": {"code": "NOT_FOUND", "message": "Identifier not found"}}` for failure (error is a structured object with `code` + `message` fields, NOT a bare string — empirically verified via direct curl on 2026-05-26). The `lib/amass.ts` `batchLookupBiomed` / `batchLookupTrial` methods unwrap the `data` envelope; the `mapLookupResult` helper extracts `error.message` to a string for caller-side rendering, preserving positional index alignment with the input items. **Never assume HTTP 200 means every item succeeded. Never render `error` as a React child directly — extract `.message` first or React #31 crashes the surface.**

6. **Lookup endpoints translate PMID/DOI/NCT → canonical `AMBC_`/`AMTC_` before fetching by ID.** Raw HTTP `GET /records/{id}` accepts **only** canonical Amass IDs — passing a PMID directly returns 404. The workflow is always: `POST /records/lookup` with `[{pmid: "..."}]` → read `amassIds[0]` (handling per-item-error per Rule #5) → `GET /records/{amassId}`. The `lib/amass.ts` `resolvePmid` / `resolveDoi` / `resolveNct` helpers encode this discipline.

7. **Idle-timeout + analyst-visible cancel button on long-running fan-outs.** Three requirements: (a) the route wraps any fan-out async generator in `withIdleTimeout(gen, 180_000)` — if no chunk arrives for 180s, the wrapper throws; (b) the client renders an analyst-visible **Cancel** button next to the primary action while a fan-out is in flight; (c) the route wraps body parse + client setup in an outer `try/catch` returning `Response.json({error}, {status: 500})`. Without all three, a single stalled Amass call locks the UI indefinitely.

8. **Ground-truth discipline.** Every URL, type, function name, version, and config shape in this SKILL.md must come from a source the agent can read — a fetched doc page, a `.d.ts` in `node_modules/@amass/sdk/`, the installed package's exports, or a verbatim quote from the Amass API documentation. If you can't point to a source, don't write it. Forbidden: fabricating endpoints; guessing field names; `as unknown as ...` or `as any` on `@amass/sdk` values; ignoring `tsc` errors. When the runtime contradicts what's written here, fix the cause.

### Per-prototype hard rules

9. **Caller-supplied bibliography snapshot — lookup + get-by-ID exclusively (v0.1).** The tool takes a curated PMID list (caller's stored bibliography snapshot at time t0); periodic re-audit re-resolves the same PMIDs to detect retractions added between t0 and tN. v0.1 uses `POST .../records/lookup` + `GET .../records/{amassId}?include=...` exclusively — NOT BiomedCore search. Rationale: the lookup-only path keeps v0.1 strictly within documented Amass API guarantees; a v1.0 search-driven extension that auto-discovers newly-retracted papers across a topic area would be valuable but lives outside v0.1's scope (it is queued under "Want to extend it?" in Hand-off as a search-driven discovery follow-up).

10. **Three-direction cascade in ONE record fetch.** Every per-paper walk uses `GET /api/v1/cores/biomedcore/records/{amassId}?include=references,citedBy,referencesTrialCore` to retrieve outbound (`references`) + inbound (`citedBy`) + cross-core (`referencesTrialCore`) directions in a single HTTP call. NO second HTTP call for the inbound direction (vs OpenAlex's `cited_by` requiring a separate `/works?filter=cites:{id}` call); NO second vendor for the cross-core direction (vs OpenAlex's missing trial entity). Rationale: the single-record-fetch three-direction conjunction (with `isRetracted` as a default field) is the load-bearing distinctive the cascade workflow exists to demonstrate — collapsing it to multiple calls or multiple vendors defeats the value proposition that justifies the prototype.

11. **Per-item-error verbatim preservation.** Surface the upstream-generated per-item error string verbatim in the `lookup_error` column of the cascade-report row — never paraphrased, never elided, never normalised. The `mapLookupResult` helper in `lib/amass.ts` enforces this by passing the raw `r.error` string through unchanged. Rationale: for an auditable retraction-cascade chain where the SR / regulatory-affairs / medical-info reviewer is making a pull-from-dossier decision, "this PMID is unresolved with reason X" vs "this PMID is silently absent" is the difference between an auditable gap and an audit failure; paraphrasing the upstream reason string collapses the two.

12. **Paper→trial direction only on the cross-core walk (v0.1).** v0.1 sets `include=referencesTrialCore` on the paper-side BiomedCore GET; the trial-side-driven "describe-this-trial" reverse walk (NCT → all retracted-or-not supporting publications via `referencesBiomedCore`) is explicitly foreclosed because at-scale symmetry of the cross-core spine is not yet a published guarantee. Empty `referencesTrialCore` arrays (a retracted paper that describes no clinical trial — common for retracted review articles, retracted commentary, retracted basic-science papers) render as **honest emptiness** in the cross-core panel — an explicit "no cited trial in cross-core spine" sidecar note — not as a workflow halt and not as confabulated trial linkages. Rationale: foreclosing the reverse direction keeps v0.1 within published guarantees while the cascade workflow itself (retracted-paper → cited-trial direction) is complete; pipelines wanting both-direction completeness can union with `referencesBiomedCore` (a second `GET /api/v1/cores/trialcore/records/{amtcId}?include=referencesBiomedCore` call per surfaced trial) — out-of-scope for v0.1.

13. **Worked-example anchoring (verify-then-ship-strictly).** The cascade dashboard DISPLAYS `isRetracted` for cascade-tracked papers (the displayed field IS the claim — display=claim rule) AND the workflow ASSERTS retraction events as cascade triggers ("this paper's retraction caused these N downstream papers to carry contamination"). Both display and assertion appear within one workflow, so the workflow is defamation-adjacent. The "Try sample" PMID list MUST use a web-verified retracted paper — Wakefield Lancet 1998 PMID 9500320 (verified via WebFetch on 2026-05-21 against PubMed at https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9500320/ and against Retraction Watch at https://retractionwatch.com/?s=wakefield+lancet+1998). Carry the caveat marker `[identifier-verified per WebFetch against PubMed + Retraction Watch on 2026-05-21; PMID 9500320 = Wakefield et al. Lancet 1998 351(9103):637-41, fully retracted 2010-02-06 (PMID 20137807); partial retraction of interpretation 2004-03-06 (PMID 15016483)]` at three anchor sites: the title intro paragraph, the Try-sample tooltip, and the Hand-off verification preamble. The `isRetracted` column in every rendered row populates from the **live Amass record at run time**, NEVER from a hardcoded fixture, NEVER from a real-PMID-flipped-to-retracted-for-illustration — because an unsupported retraction display IS a retraction claim against the named work. The live-Amass-binding requirement structurally preserves the guard (Lovable scaffolds against the live API, not against fabricated retraction data). Rationale: the cascade UI demonstrates Amass's value by surfacing a REAL retraction with a REAL three-direction cascade — the Wakefield paper is the canonical demonstration because its retraction is documented for 14+ years, undisputed, and the cascade is bibliographically well-characterised (~3,000+ citing papers per published bibliometrics). Confabulating any of the load-bearing identifiers would be defamation-adjacent shipping.

**`app/api/cascade-audit/route.ts`** — Next.js App Router POST handler. Takes a `{pmids: string[]}` body (the stored bibliography snapshot per Hard Rule #9), runs batch lookup to resolve `AMBC_` IDs, fans out the per-paper GET with `include=references,citedBy,referencesTrialCore` (per Hard Rule #10) wrapped in `withIdleTimeout(gen, 180_000)` per Hard Rule #7, filters to `isRetracted === true`, and returns the cascade keyed by retracted `AMBC_`. Non-streaming consolidated JSON response for v0.1.

The two snippets above are the only `lib/<file>.ts` + `app/api/<route>/route.ts` mandated by this prototype. v0.1 returns the assembled cascade report in-memory in a single consolidated response — there is no persistence module, no `lib/cascade-store.ts`, no monthly re-audit cron, and no diff-against-prior-pass module. Download / copy-to-clipboard happens client-side from the response payload. If a downstream extension needs persistence (monthly re-audit history, week-over-week diff), the extension SKILL.md includes its own minimal stub per the template's policy — never an `import` from `@/lib/<x>` without a matching snippet.

## Required reading

- `https://platform.amass.tech` — Amass Platform docs + API credentials
- `https://github.com/amass-technologies/public-amass-platform-starter-ts` — official Amass Platform Starter (Apache-2.0; Bun + Ink CLI REPL with BiomedCore + TrialCore tools wired up). The engineer-facing complement to this web-app kit.

## Hand-off

Build, lint, and typecheck must pass.

**Credentials.** Get your `AMASS_API_KEY` from https://platform.amass.tech and add it to `.env`. Do NOT use `AskUserQuestion` to gate scaffolding on credentials — Lovable's (or any AI builder's) standard env-var prompt covers this at run time. Just scaffold the app with placeholder `.env`, then run `npm run dev` once the key is in place.

Then present the hand-off summary. The four verification steps bind to the WebFetch-verified Wakefield Lancet 1998 worked example `[identifier-verified per WebFetch against PubMed + Retraction Watch on 2026-05-21; PMID 9500320 = Wakefield et al. Lancet 1998 351(9103):637-41, fully retracted 2010-02-06 (PMID 20137807); partial retraction of interpretation 2004-03-06 (PMID 15016483)]`:

> **Your Retraction Cascade Monitor is ready.**
>
> Before first push (if your AI builder left scaffolding placeholders): remove any `data-lovable-blank-page-placeholder="REMOVE_THIS"` attributes, any `<img>` tags pointing at `cdn.gpteng.co` or similar builder-placeholder CDNs, and any leftover "your app will live here" boilerplate. These render invisibly but pollute the DOM and serve no purpose in production. Search the codebase for `REMOVE_THIS` and `gpteng` before committing.
>
> To run it: fill in `.env` and run `npm run dev`.
>
> Verify it works:
> - Click **Try sample** to load the seed PMID list (PMID 9500320 — Wakefield Lancet 1998 — plus ~10 context PMIDs from the autism-vaccination methodology literature); click **Run cascade audit**. Confirm the retracted-papers panel (left) surfaces PMID 9500320 with `isRetracted=true` rendered in IBM Plex Mono next to the title "Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children" and journal "Lancet" — the `isRetracted` value reads from the live Amass record at run time per Hard Rule #13, never from a hardcoded fixture.
> - Confirm the inbound cascade panel (center) populates with a non-empty list of `AMBC_` IDs from PMID 9500320's `citedBy` array — these are papers in Amass that cite Wakefield (expect dozens to hundreds depending on Amass's PubMed coverage of the autism-vaccination citation literature; the cardinality is live-from-Amass, never hardcoded). Click any cited paper to view its title/journal/date in IBM Plex Mono.
> - Confirm the outbound cascade panel (right) populates with the `AMBC_` IDs from PMID 9500320's `references` array — these are the papers Wakefield itself cited. The combined inbound + outbound + cross-core delivery in ONE GET call (`include=references,citedBy,referencesTrialCore`) is the load-bearing distinctive per Hard Rule #10 — there is no second HTTP call for the inbound direction, vs OpenAlex's `cited_by` requiring a separate `/works?filter=cites:{id}` call.
> - Confirm the cross-core panel (right-bottom) renders either the `AMTC_` IDs of clinical trials Wakefield's paper describes — OR renders honest emptiness (`"no cited trial in cross-core spine"` per Hard Rule #12) if Wakefield's paper does not describe a registered clinical trial. The honest-emptiness frame is load-bearing: a v0.1 surface that confabulated trial linkages on a retracted paper would be defamation-adjacent shipping per Hard Rule #13.
>
> Want to extend it?
> - Add a monthly re-audit cron with diff against the prior pass — surfaces newly-retracted citations between t0 (the bibliography snapshot) and tN (the re-audit cycle); persists the cascade report append-only so SR teams / regulatory affairs / medical-info teams can reconstruct the contamination state at any prior cycle. The cron lives at `app/api/cascade-cron/route.ts` with append-only persistence in a `lib/cascade-store.ts` stub.
> - Add a v1.0 search-driven discovery extension — uses BiomedCore search with `isRetracted=true` + topic filters to auto-discover newly-retracted papers across an indication or a sponsor's literature rather than against a stored bibliography. Out of scope for v0.1 — gated on additional Amass API support for retraction-filtered search.
> - Add a cross-core sponsor-level cascade — "all trials by sponsor X — any retraction-cascaded via cited literature?" — using `TrialCore search` by `sponsorName` + per-trial `referencesBiomedCore` walk + retraction check on the cited papers. Inherits the cross-core symmetry caveat per Hard Rule #12 (both-direction completeness via the reverse `referencesBiomedCore` walk is not yet a published guarantee).
