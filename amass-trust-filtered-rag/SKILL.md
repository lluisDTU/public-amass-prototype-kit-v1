# Trust-Filtered Biomedical RAG (Amass MCP)

Build a working trust-filtered biomedical RAG surface on the Amass API. The user is an LLM-tooling builder who just got Amass API credentials and wants a Next.js + TypeScript chat UI exercising a real MCP tool flow running locally in under five minutes.

The scaffold ships two layers in one repo: (1) an **MCP server** in `lib/mcp-tools.ts` exposing two tools — `fetch_credible_evidence_by_id(ids[], min_jufo?, allow_retracted?, min_citation_count?)` returning canonical-AMBC-resolved + trust-filtered evidence; `get_credible_paper_with_trials(amass_id, include_fulltext?)` returning a single paper with cross-core trial linkage — and (2) a **Next.js chat UI** that consumes the same MCP tool handlers in-process so a Lovable user sees the end-to-end MCP flow on first run. The builder can lift the MCP server boundary into their own agent stack (Claude Desktop, MCP-aware Cursor, custom orchestrator) by pointing `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector` or a stdio launcher at `lib/mcp-tools.ts`. The worked example binds to PMID 37861218 (Ahn MJ et al. NEJM 2023 — Tarlatamab DeLLphi-301 primary publication). `[Tarlatamab worked example shape-illustrative; PMID 37861218 verified against PubMed + ClinicalTrials.gov + FDA approval letter at draft time; re-verify before binding to a real RAG production workflow]`

## Stack — flexible at the framework layer, principle-pinned at the API layer

**TypeScript + React + a server-function-capable framework.** Lovable defaults to **TanStack Start** (`@tanstack/react-router` + `@tanstack/react-start`'s `createServerFn` for server-side handlers). **Next.js (App Router)** with `app/api/<endpoint>/route.ts` POST handlers is the equivalent alternative path. Both work end-to-end against the same `lib/amass.ts` client; pick whichever your AI builder produces by default. The Amass primitives (canonical-ID resolution + per-item-error semantics + cross-core walks + trust filters) are stack-agnostic — the framework only wraps them.

**The MCP-server boundary is architecturally distinct in this prototype.** (i) The MCP server in `lib/mcp-tools.ts` is **framework-agnostic Node.js + `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`**; its stdio launcher (`node lib/mcp-tools.js`) works identically under both stacks. (ii) Where framework selection bites is the in-process chat route that consumes the same tool handlers: **Next.js App Router** uses `app/api/mcp-chat/route.ts` with `export async function POST(req)`; **TanStack Start** uses `src/lib/mcp-chat.functions.ts` with `createServerFn({ method: "POST" })`. The tool handlers themselves (exported as plain `async` functions from `lib/mcp-tools.ts`) are identical across both — only the route wrapper differs.

What IS pinned (load-bearing):

```json
"react":                     "^18.3.1",
"react-dom":                 "^18.3.1",
"typescript":                "^5.4.5",
"zod":                       "^3.23.8",
"lucide-react":              "^0.453.0",
"server-only":               "^0.0.1",
"ai":                        "^4.0.18",
"@ai-sdk/react":             "^1.0.7",
"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk": "1.29.0"
```

What's framework-specific (one set OR the other, not both):

- **TanStack Start path**: `@tanstack/react-router`, `@tanstack/react-start`, `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`.
- **Next.js (App Router) path**: `next` (latest stable), `@types/node`.

Pin with caret ranges (`^x.y.z`) for compatible patch updates. `zod` is pinned because the tool input schemas (`FetchCredibleEvidenceInput` / `GetCredibleEvidenceInput`) are both the MCP tool-advertisement contract and the chat-route validation contract — silent zod-version drift in default-value or refine semantics shifts what the tools accept. `server-only` is pinned because it is the build-time enforcement Hard Rule #2 depends on (works identically in Next.js and TanStack Start). `ai` + `@ai-sdk/react` are pinned because v0.1 uses them for the chat-UI streaming layer above the MCP tools. **Pin `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` exactly (no caret)** because the tool-schema serialization shape couples to the SDK's `Server` class + `setRequestHandler` shape; any minor-version bump can break the in-process chat-route wiring.

After scaffolding, run `npm install`. If any package fails to resolve, check `node_modules/<pkg>/package.json` for the latest stable version and update accordingly.

**Three notes for AI builders that may produce either path.** (1) The route file location differs: TanStack Start uses `src/lib/<name>.functions.ts` with `createServerFn({ method: "POST" }).inputValidator(...).handler(...)`; Next.js App Router uses `app/api/<endpoint>/route.ts` with `export async function POST(req: Request)`. The reference snippet below is shown in Next.js shape — if your builder produces TanStack Start, translate the `POST(req)` handler in `app/api/mcp-chat/route.ts` to `createServerFn(...).handler(async ({ data }) => ...)` in `src/lib/mcp-chat.functions.ts` and the `req.json()` body parse to `.inputValidator((input) => FetchCredibleEvidenceInput.parse(input))`. (2) The page file location differs: TanStack Router uses `src/routes/index.tsx` with `createFileRoute("/")`; Next.js App Router uses `app/page.tsx`. Either way, the page calls into the server function / route handler the same way at the network level. (3) **The outer `try/catch` wrapping the handler body MUST be preserved when translating to TanStack Start.** The Next.js reference snippet wraps the chat logic in `try { ... } catch (err) { return Response.json({error: ...}, {status: 500}) }`. For TanStack Start, wrap the `.handler()` body in `try { ... } catch (err) { throw new Error(err instanceof Error ? err.message : "Chat call failed"); }` — the throw surfaces as `mutation.error.message` on the client (TanStack Query's `useMutation` `isError` path) and renders in the chat surface's inline error region. Without this wrap, an uncaught throw from any API call propagates to TanStack Router's route-level error boundary and crashes the whole page instead of surfacing as a chat error. Load-bearing for the kit's "per-item error renders inline without crashing the surface" claim.

## What the app should do

The primary builder-visible payoff is a **Next.js chat UI demonstrating the MCP-tool flow end-to-end** — the user pastes a PMID/DOI/AMBC list (or types a natural-language follow-up), the chat surface invokes `fetch_credible_evidence_by_id` against the MCP server's in-process handlers, and the resulting trust-filtered evidence cards render inline below the assistant turn. The load-bearing Amass primitive demonstrated is the **trust-filter conjunction in the same response as the cited evidence** (JuFo journal-quality + retraction flag + citation-count post-filters on a canonical-ID-resolved record set, plus the paper↔trial cross-core walk) — the residual that distinguishes this RAG surface from OpenAlex-MCP and other biomedical MCP layers.

The input surface is a **chat textarea accepting PMIDs / DOIs / `AMBC_` IDs as comma-or-newline-separated identifiers**, plus a toggle for `include_fulltext` and per-message threshold overrides (`min_jufo`, `allow_retracted`, `min_citation_count`) exposed as small chips above the textarea. The empty-state "Try sample" loads a small illustrative biomedical query verbatim: `Fetch credible evidence for PMID 37861218` (Tarlatamab DeLLphi-301 primary publication). The tooltip on the Try-sample button reads "Ahn MJ et al. NEJM 2023 — tarlatamab pivotal trial in extensive-stage SCLC. `[Tarlatamab worked example shape-illustrative; PMID 37861218 verified against PubMed + ClinicalTrials.gov + FDA approval letter at draft time; re-verify before binding to a real RAG production workflow]`".

The chat flow per turn: the user message triggers `fetch_credible_evidence_by_id` on the in-process MCP handler — Call 1 `batchLookupBiomed` (resolve PMIDs / DOIs to canonical `AMBC_`) + Call 2 per-paper `getBiomedRecord` fan-out (read `isRetracted` + `journalQualityJufo` + `citationCount` from the returned record) + client-side trust-filter post-filter — returning filtered evidence records that the assistant turn renders as evidence cards. A follow-up "Get with trials" button on each card triggers `get_credible_paper_with_trials(amass_id, include_fulltext: true)` which returns the full record with `referencesTrialCore` + `citedBy` (+ `fulltext` if toggled) populated for cross-core trial linkage rendering. The `getBiomedRecord` fan-out wraps in `withIdleTimeout(walkPapers(), 180_000)` per Hard Rule #7 with a chat-message-scoped **Cancel** button next to the assistant's pending indicator while the fan-out is in flight; a stalled Amass call past 180s surfaces a "stream stalled — an Amass call likely hung" message bubble rather than locking the chat surface indefinitely.

The final state per assistant turn is a **rendered evidence-card panel** below the assistant message — one card per paper showing PMID (IBM Plex Mono) + JuFo badge (1-3, ★ icon) + isRetracted badge (rendered from the live Amass record; empty when `isRetracted = false`, red `Retracted` chip when `true`) + `citationCount` value + optional `fulltext` excerpt (first ~280 chars when `include_fulltext = true`) + cross-core `referencesTrialCore` chips (clickable `AMTC_` IDs that re-issue `get_credible_paper_with_trials` to render the trial-side details inline). Each card carries an "MCP tool call" disclosure that surfaces the underlying `fetch_credible_evidence_by_id` / `get_credible_paper_with_trials` payload as JSON — the builder's debugging affordance for lifting the MCP boundary into their own agent stack. Render PMIDs / DOIs / NCTs / `AMBC_` / `AMTC_` IDs in IBM Plex Mono; prose in Inter (Brand reference). Use Lucide React for icons. Lovable produces the chat-UI shape from this spec — variability across builders is fine; the load-bearing constraint is that the four paragraphs above demonstrate the MCP-tool flow, the trust-filter post-filter discipline, the cross-core trial linkage, and the worked-example anchor.

## Hard rules

The 8 Amass-universal rules below are inherited verbatim across all 6 prototype SKILL.mds. Per-prototype rules 9-12 cover the load-bearing UX / error / discipline surfaces specific to this prototype's MCP-server-wrapped-as-Next.js-chat architecture.

1. **Credentials never enter committed code.** Generate `.env` and `.gitignore` it. Only ONE secret is asked of the user at hand-off:
   ```env
   AMASS_API_KEY=your_amass_api_key_here
   ```
   Per Amass API conventions: the key reads from `AMASS_API_KEY`. The base URL is **hardcoded** to `https://api.amass.tech` in `lib/amass.ts` (single production base; no per-user variance). To point at staging or a local proxy for development, edit the `AMASS_API_BASE_URL` constant in `lib/amass.ts` directly — do NOT re-introduce an env var for this (adding `process.env.AMASS_API_BASE_URL` to `lib/amass.ts` causes Lovable's secrets-UX to prompt the user for a value they don't have, which is unnecessary friction). Never hardcode the API key, never log it, never commit it.

2. **Server-only `AmassClient`.** Lives in `lib/amass.ts` with `import "server-only"` at the top. Never imported from a `"use client"` component. The browser only ever speaks to `/api/<endpoint>`. The Bearer token must never reach the browser bundle; the `server-only` package enforces this at build time. The MCP tool handlers in `lib/mcp-tools.ts` also import `lib/amass.ts` server-side only — when the MCP server is launched as a stdio process for an external MCP client, it runs in a Node.js server context, never a browser bundle.

3. **Singleton/cached `AmassClient`.** Created once on server boot via `getAmassClient()` factory, cached via `clientPromise ??=` pattern. Per-request instantiation is wasted work; the Bearer header is computed once at module-import time and reused. The same singleton serves both the Next.js chat route AND the MCP server's stdio invocation — no double-wrapping.

4. **`Authorization: Bearer ${AMASS_API_KEY}` on every Amass request.** On `401` / `403`, surface the credential error directly — retry won't fix it. On `429`, read `Retry-After` and back off exponentially (per the `lib/amass.ts` snippet below). Rate limit is **60 requests / 60 seconds, per user+org** — the per-call retry helper IS the rate-limit defence for agentic-loop fan-out workflows.

5. **Read from the `data` key; handle errors at top-level AND per-item.** Two distinct error shapes: top-level (any non-2xx) — `{"error": {"status": ..., "code": ..., "message": ...}}` — caught by the route's outer `try/catch` AND by the MCP tool handler's outer `try/catch`. Per-item (`POST /records/lookup` returns HTTP 200 with body `{"data": [...]}` — the universal envelope applies here too) — each array element echoes the input alongside the result: `{"input": {...}, "amassIds": ["AMBC_..."]}` for success, or `{"input": {...}, "error": {"code": "NOT_FOUND", "message": "Identifier not found"}}` for failure (error is a structured object with `code` + `message` fields, NOT a bare string — empirically verified via direct curl on 2026-05-26). The `lib/amass.ts` `batchLookupBiomed` / `batchLookupTrial` methods unwrap the `data` envelope; the `mapLookupResult` helper extracts `error.message` to a string for caller-side rendering, preserving positional index alignment with the input items. **Never assume HTTP 200 means every item succeeded. Never render `error` as a React child directly — extract `.message` first or React #31 crashes the surface.**

6. **Lookup endpoints translate PMID/DOI/NCT → canonical `AMBC_`/`AMTC_` before fetching by ID.** Raw HTTP `GET /records/{id}` accepts **only** canonical Amass IDs — passing a PMID directly returns 404. The workflow is always: `POST /records/lookup` with `[{pmid: "..."}]` → read `amassIds[0]` (handling per-item-error per Rule #5) → `GET /records/{amassId}`. The `lib/amass.ts` `resolvePmid` / `resolveDoi` / `resolveNct` helpers encode this discipline. `fetch_credible_evidence_by_id` accepts mixed input — PMIDs, DOIs, and `AMBC_` IDs in the same `ids[]` array — and routes each to the correct lookup / get path inline.

7. **Idle-timeout + chat-visible cancel button on long-running fan-outs.** Three requirements: (a) the chat-route + MCP-tool handler wrap any fan-out async generator in `withIdleTimeout(gen, 180_000)` — if no chunk arrives for 180s, the wrapper throws; (b) the chat UI renders a **Cancel** button next to the pending-assistant-message indicator while a fan-out is in flight; (c) the route + MCP tool handler wrap body parse + client setup in an outer `try/catch` returning a structured error rather than crashing the chat surface. Without all three, a single stalled Amass call locks the chat UI indefinitely.

8. **Ground-truth discipline.** Every URL, type, function name, version, and config shape in this SKILL.md must come from a source the agent can read — a fetched doc page, a `.d.ts` in `node_modules/@amass/sdk/`, or the installed package's exports. If you can't point to a source, don't write it. Forbidden: fabricating endpoints; guessing field names; `as unknown as ...` or `as any` on `@amass/sdk` or `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` values; ignoring `tsc` errors. When the runtime contradicts what's written here, fix the cause.

### Per-prototype hard rules

9. **MCP-server-wrapped-as-Next.js-chat architecture.** The MCP server is defined in `lib/mcp-tools.ts` using `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and exposes two tools (`fetch_credible_evidence_by_id` + `get_credible_paper_with_trials`) to any MCP-aware client via stdio. The Next.js chat UI in `app/page.tsx` + `app/api/mcp-chat/route.ts` instantiates the same in-process tool handlers (exported as plain `async` functions from `lib/mcp-tools.ts` alongside the MCP `Server` wiring) and routes the chat flow through them — so the Lovable user sees the end-to-end MCP tool flow on first run without configuring an external MCP client. Builders who want to lift the MCP boundary into their own agent stack point `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node lib/mcp-tools.js` at the stdio entry, or configure the file as an MCP server in Claude Desktop / Cursor / a custom orchestrator. Rationale: the two-surface architecture (MCP boundary + Next.js demo) is the load-bearing affordance — Lovable users see the end-to-end MCP flow on first run, AND builders can lift the MCP boundary into a Claude Desktop / MCP-aware Cursor / custom agent stack via `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node lib/mcp-tools.js`.

10. **Trust-filter post-filter discipline.** v0.1 routes around BiomedCore search-driven retrieval — `fetch_credible_evidence_by_id` resolves caller-supplied PMIDs/DOIs/`AMBC_` to canonical AMBC_ via lookup + per-paper GET, then post-filters the returned records on `isRetracted` (server-side default field) + `journalQualityJufo` (client-side post-filter on the returned field) + `citationCount` (client-side post-filter on the returned field — `minCitationCount` is not currently exposed as a server-side filter on BiomedCore search). v1.0 search-driven discovery — adding a `find_credible_evidence(query, ...)` tool with server-side `minJournalQualityJufo` — is deferred until the BiomedCore search surface stabilises around no-token-match fallback behaviour and JuFo filter semantics. Until then, the lookup-and-retrieve v0.1 is the load-bearing surface. Rationale: the v0.1's load-bearing residual is the trust-filter conjunction in the same response as the cited evidence — surfacing the trust signals as post-filters on lookup-and-retrieve preserves the residual.

11. **`include=fulltext` cost-discipline.** `include=fulltext` is opt-in only — the chat-UI toggle defaults to `false` and the `get_credible_paper_with_trials` tool's `include_fulltext` parameter defaults to `false`. Per `CLAUDE.md` API conventions: "use `include=fulltext` only when actually needed; responses balloon otherwise." The chat-UI toggle carries an inline tooltip surfacing the LLM token-cost tradeoff verbatim: "Fulltext responses balloon many KB per paper — token-cost on the downstream LLM scales accordingly. Toggle on only when grounding requires fulltext span citation, not just abstract + metadata." Rationale: LLM-tooling builders pay OpenAI/Anthropic API credits per call — a fulltext-by-default discipline silently 10×s their per-call cost without delivering proportional value when abstract + cross-core trial linkage already supports the answer.

12. **Worked-example anchoring (shape-illustrative; defamation-adjacent guard preserved).** The "Try sample" chat prompt binds the Tarlatamab DeLLphi-301 primary publication identifier verbatim — PMID 37861218 (Ahn MJ et al. NEJM 2023; verified `isRetracted = false` at draft time). The `isRetracted` badge in every rendered evidence card populates from the **live Amass record at run time**, never from a hardcoded fixture — defamation-adjacent fixture patterns are explicitly forbidden across all tiers (an unsupported retraction display IS a retraction claim against the named work). Carry the caveat marker `[Tarlatamab worked example shape-illustrative; PMID 37861218 verified against PubMed + ClinicalTrials.gov + FDA approval letter at draft time; re-verify before binding to a real RAG production workflow]` at three anchor sites: the title intro paragraph, the Try-sample tooltip, and the Hand-off verification preamble. Rationale: the worked example is illustrative of the MCP-tool flow rather than a load-bearing public-facing retraction-or-claim-assertion — the live-Amass-binding requirement structurally preserves the defamation-adjacent guard (Lovable scaffolds against the live API, not against fabricated retraction data).

The three snippets above are the only `lib/<file>.ts` + `app/api/<route>/route.ts` mandated by this prototype. v0.1 ships the MCP server stdio entry + the Next.js chat surface in one repo. Download / copy-to-clipboard for evidence cards happens client-side from the chat response payload. If a downstream extension needs persistence (chat-history append-only, ack-event lifecycle for retracted-evidence flagging, per-session conversation memory), the extension SKILL.md includes its own minimal stub per the template's policy — never an `import` from `@/lib/<x>` without a matching snippet.

- `https://github.com/amass-technologies/public-amass-platform-starter-ts` — official Amass Platform Starter (Apache-2.0; Bun + Ink CLI REPL with BiomedCore + TrialCore tools wired up). The engineer-facing complement to this web-app kit.
- `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs` — Model Context Protocol spec (tool definition shape, `Server` class, `StdioServerTransport`, `ListToolsRequestSchema` + `CallToolRequestSchema` request handlers); load-bearing for this prototype's MCP server boundary.

## Hand-off

Build, lint, and typecheck must pass.

**Credentials.** Get your `AMASS_API_KEY` from https://platform.amass.tech and add it to `.env`. Do NOT use `AskUserQuestion` to gate scaffolding on credentials — Lovable's (or any AI builder's) standard env-var prompt covers this at run time. Just scaffold the app with placeholder `.env`, then run `npm run dev` once the key is in place.

Then present the hand-off summary. The four verification steps bind to the Tarlatamab DeLLphi-301 worked example `[Tarlatamab worked example shape-illustrative; PMID 37861218 verified against PubMed + ClinicalTrials.gov + FDA approval letter at draft time; re-verify before binding to a real RAG production workflow]`:

> **Your Trust-Filtered Biomedical RAG (Amass MCP) is ready.**
>
> Before first push (if your AI builder left scaffolding placeholders): remove any `data-lovable-blank-page-placeholder="REMOVE_THIS"` attributes, any `<img>` tags pointing at `cdn.gpteng.co` or similar builder-placeholder CDNs, and any leftover "your app will live here" boilerplate. These render invisibly but pollute the DOM and serve no purpose in production. Search the codebase for `REMOVE_THIS` and `gpteng` before committing.
>
> To run it: fill in `.env` and run `npm run dev`.
>
> Verify it works:
> - In the chat textarea, click **Try sample** to load `Fetch credible evidence for PMID 37861218`; press Enter. Confirm `fetch_credible_evidence_by_id` returns one evidence card showing the Ahn MJ et al. NEJM 2023 record — title rendered in Inter; PMID 37861218 in IBM Plex Mono; JuFo badge = 3 (NEJM is a JuFo tier-3 journal); `isRetracted` badge empty (live value from Amass — not hardcoded fixture per Hard Rule #12); `citationCount` populated.
> - Click the **Get with trials** button on the resolved evidence card; confirm `get_credible_paper_with_trials` returns the full record with `referencesTrialCore` populated including the DeLLphi-301 `AMTC_` chip (the cross-core trial-linkage primitive that distinguishes this RAG surface from MCP layers without first-class trial entities).
> - Toggle the `include_fulltext` chip above the chat textarea to **on**, then re-issue **Get with trials** on the same card; confirm the evidence card surfaces a fulltext excerpt (first ~280 chars) — OR an inline "fulltext unavailable" note if Amass does not hold fulltext for this PMID (per the `hasFulltext` field semantics). The tooltip on the toggle should warn about LLM token-cost ballooning per Hard Rule #11.
> - Run an MCP-inspector probe against the stdio server in a separate terminal: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node lib/mcp-tools.js` (after the project compiles). Confirm both tools — `fetch_credible_evidence_by_id` + `get_credible_paper_with_trials` — enumerate with the JSON-schema shape declared in the `ListToolsRequestSchema` handler. Then call `fetch_credible_evidence_by_id` from the inspector with `{ids: ["37861218"]}`; confirm the result mirrors the in-chat result (same canonical AMBC_ + same trust-filter outcome) — verifies the in-process tool handler is identical to the MCP-boundary tool handler per Hard Rule #9.
>
> Want to extend it?
> - **v1.0 search-driven RAG.** Add a `find_credible_evidence(query, min_jufo, allow_retracted, ...)` MCP tool once the BiomedCore search surface stabilises around no-token-match fallback behaviour and JuFo filter semantics. Until then, the lookup-and-retrieve v0.1 is the load-bearing surface.
> - **Lift the MCP boundary into a Claude Desktop / Cursor / custom agent stack.** Configure `lib/mcp-tools.ts` as an MCP server entry in the host agent's MCP configuration (`{"mcpServers": {"amass-trust-filtered-rag": {"command": "node", "args": ["path/to/lib/mcp-tools.js"], "env": {"AMASS_API_KEY": "..."}}}}`) — the same two tools become callable from the host LLM's tool-use loop without the Next.js chat layer.
> - **Extend `fetch_credible_evidence_by_id` to support NCT alongside PMID + DOI + AMBC_.** Pass NCTs through `client.batchLookupTrial` → resolve to `AMTC_` → optionally `getTrialRecord` with `include=referencesBiomedCore` to walk trial→paper for grounding evidence on a trial-led question. The reverse direction (trial → paper) is foreclosed for v0.1 because at-scale symmetry of the cross-core spine is not yet a published guarantee — extending here requires the at-scale-symmetry caveat to surface in the chat-UI tooltip.
